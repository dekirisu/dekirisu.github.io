## Using Analog as a SSG
Used <img src="./public/software/analog.svg" width="20"/> [Analog](https://analogjs.org) to generate static pages, the stack is:
- <img src="./public/software/vite.svg" width="20"/> [Vite](https://vite.dev/) `v7.0`
- <img src="./public/software/angular.svg" width="20"/> [Angular](https://vite.dev/) `v20.1`
- <img src="./public/software/tailwindcss.svg" width="20"/> [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) `v4.1`

Is it overkill for this purpose? `yes üê¢`
